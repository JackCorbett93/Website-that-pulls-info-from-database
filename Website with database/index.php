                    <p> QuirkiStuff offers you the chance to own truly unique and one-off pieces of furniture. Combining vibrant colours with interesting shapes and using either transformed pre-loved objects or original designs, QuirkiStuff pieces are both affordable & perfect for contemporary living. With a dynamic & original piece of furniture from QuirkiStuff you can inject a splash of colour that will re-energise your room and create a totally new atmosphere…without breaking the bank. We can also customise many of our pieces in a colour you love or a size that suits your space. Some items have already been sold, but if you see something you like, chances are we can make something similar for you. We are always thinking of new designs and on the look out for pre-loved objects that have “good bones” and the potential for transformation. So if you like QuirkiStuff so far...get browsing…and keep in touch! </p>
